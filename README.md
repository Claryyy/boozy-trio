### Comments

This was my first time using Vue and it's been an interesting challenge to build this app in a few days.
I created the app using the `npm init vue@latest` command to get setup with all the files needed.

I then took some time to read the Vue docs and wrap my head around the way components are written in Vue (scripts, style and template are in the same file). It makes for a folder structure that is much cleaner.

I then took some time to refine the UI and styles for the different breakpoints.

For unit testing, I used Vitest as recommend by the Vue3 docs.

I then created a Dockerfile.
